# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
    
- Good Visualization
  
Title: "U.S. Unemployment Rate by Month (2010-2020)"
Source: Public Tableau

Description:
This line graph tracks monthly unemployment rates over a decade, highlighting events like the 2020 pandemic with color-coded sections. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis shows the unemployment rate percentage.

Evaluation:

- Clarity: The axes are well-labeled, and the graph uses a minimalist design, ensuring data is easy to interpret.
- Accuracy: Data points are plotted accurately with no distortion of values or scales.
- Relevance: Contextual markers, like the pandemic, make the graph meaningful and timely.
- Aesthetics: The color-coded segments and clean layout ensure visual appeal while avoiding clutter.
  
Why it‚Äôs good:

The visualization adheres to Edward Tufte's principle of maximizing the "data-ink ratio," focusing on relevant information while avoiding unnecessary embellishments. Gestalt principles, such as proximity and similarity, help group and distinguish data, improving interpretability. Overall, it effectively communicates trends and provides actionable insights.

- Bad Visualization
  
Title: "Favorite Ice Cream Flavors by Age Group"
Source: Data Viz Project

Description:
This pie chart displays the distribution of favorite ice cream flavors across age groups, subdivided into small slices for each flavor.

Evaluation:

- Clarity: Overlapping slices and excessive details make it hard to discern patterns. Labels are too small to read, and some categories lack percentages.
- Accuracy: Misleading visual proportions hinder accurate interpretation of the data.
- Relevance: Pie charts are unsuitable for comparing categories across groups; a bar chart would be more effective.
- Aesthetics: The use of too many colors and a lack of clear legend creates visual confusion.
  


    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
   
To improve the "Favorite Ice Cream Flavors by Age Group" visualization, we can address its key flaws in clarity, relevance, and aesthetics.

1. Change the Chart Type
Pie charts are ill-suited for comparing multiple categories across groups. A grouped bar chart or stacked bar chart would be better alternatives. For example:

In a grouped bar chart, age groups are on the x-axis, with bars for each flavor, making comparisons intuitive.
A stacked bar chart would show total proportions, clearly indicating which flavors dominate each group.

2. Simplify Categories
The chart is overcrowded with tiny slices that confuse viewers. Combining similar or less significant flavors into an "Other" category can reduce complexity while maintaining interpretability.

3. Improve Labeling
Many segments lack percentages, and existing labels are too small to read. Adding clear data labels with percentages or counts for each segment and increasing font size would enhance readability.

4. Use a Consistent Color Palette
Excessive colors cause visual noise. A limited, harmonious color palette with shading variations for subcategories would make the chart easier to interpret.

5. Focus the Key Insight
The current visualization lacks a clear focus. Adding a title like ‚ÄúChocolate and Vanilla Dominate Preferences Across All Age Groups‚Äù and using annotations to highlight significant findings would make the chart more engaging.

6. Provide Contextual Information
The chart should include information about the data source, collection method, and sample size to enhance credibility and allow viewers to understand the scope of the data.

By implementing these improvements, the visualization would become more accurate, relevant, and accessible to its intended audience.












- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
